# Type Declarations

## Interfaces
```v
// interface-example.1
struct Dog {
	breed string
}

fn (d Dog) speak() string {
	return 'woof'
}

struct Cat {
	breed string
}

fn (c Cat) speak() string {
	return 'meow'
}

// unlike Go and like TypeScript, V's interfaces can define fields, not just methods.
interface Speaker {
	breed string
	speak() string
}

fn main() {
	dog := Dog{'Leonberger'}
	cat := Cat{'Siamese'}

	mut arr := []Speaker{}
	arr << dog
	arr << cat
	for item in arr {
		println('a $item.breed says: $item.speak()')
	}
}
```

### Implement an interface

A type implements an interface by implementing its methods and fields.
There is no explicit declaration of intent, no "implements" keyword.

An interface can have a `mut:` section. Implementing types will need
to have a `mut` receiver, for methods declared in the `mut:` section
of an interface.
```v
// interface-example.2
module main

pub interface Foo {
	write(string) string
}

// => the method signature of a type, implementing interface Foo should be:
// `pub fn (s Type) write(a string) string`

pub interface Bar {
mut:
	write(string) string
}

// => the method signature of a type, implementing interface Bar should be:
// `pub fn (mut s Type) write(a string) string`

struct MyStruct {}

// MyStruct implements the interface Foo, but *not* interface Bar
pub fn (s MyStruct) write(a string) string {
	return a
}

fn main() {
	s1 := MyStruct{}
	fn1(s1)
	// fn2(s1) -> compile error, since MyStruct does not implement Bar
}

fn fn1(s Foo) {
	println(s.write('Foo'))
}

// fn fn2(s Bar) { // does not match
//      println(s.write('Foo'))
// }
```

### Casting an interface

We can test the underlying type of an interface using dynamic cast operators:
```v oksyntax
// interface-exmaple.3 (continued from interface-exampe.1)
interface Something {}

fn announce(s Something) {
	if s is Dog {
		println('a $s.breed dog') // `s` is automatically cast to `Dog` (smart cast)
	} else if s is Cat {
		println('a cat speaks $s.speak()')
	} else {
		println('something else')
	}
}

fn main() {
	dog := Dog{'Leonberger'}
	cat := Cat{'Siamese'}
	announce(dog)
	announce(cat)
}
```

```v
// interface-example.4
interface IFoo {
	foo()
}

interface IBar {
	bar()
}

// implements only IFoo
struct SFoo {}

fn (sf SFoo) foo() {}

// implements both IFoo and IBar
struct SFooBar {}

fn (sfb SFooBar) foo() {}

fn (sfb SFooBar) bar() {
	dump('This implements IBar')
}

fn main() {
	mut arr := []IFoo{}
	arr << SFoo{}
	arr << SFooBar{}

	for a in arr {
		dump(a)
		// In order to execute instances that implements IBar.
		if a is IBar {
			// a.bar() // Error.
			b := a as IBar
			dump(b)
			b.bar()
		}
	}
}
```

For more information, see [Dynamic casts](#dynamic-casts).
### Interface method definitions

Also unlike Go, an interface can have it's own methods, similar to how
structs can have their methods. These 'interface methods' do not have
to be implemented, by structs which implement that interface.
They are just a convenient way to write `i.some_function()` instead of
`some_function(i)`, similar to how struct methods can be looked at, as
a convenience for writing `s.xyz()` instead of `xyz(s)`.

N.B. This feature is NOT a "default implementation" like in C#.

For example, if a struct `cat` is wrapped in an interface `a`, that has
implemented a method with the same name `speak`, as a method implemented by
the struct, and you do `a.speak()`, *only* the interface method is called:

```v
interface Adoptable {}

fn (a Adoptable) speak() string {
	return 'adopt me!'
}

struct Cat {}

fn (c Cat) speak() string {
	return 'meow!'
}

struct Dog {}

fn main() {
	cat := Cat{}
	assert dump(cat.speak()) == 'meow!'
	//
	a := Adoptable(cat)
	assert dump(a.speak()) == 'adopt me!' // call Adoptable's `speak`
	if a is Cat {
		// Inside this `if` however, V knows that `a` is not just any
		// kind of Adoptable, but actually a Cat, so it will use the
		// Cat `speak`, NOT the Adoptable `speak`:
		dump(a.speak()) // meow!
	}
	//
	b := Adoptable(Dog{})
	assert dump(b.speak()) == 'adopt me!' // call Adoptable's `speak`
	// if b is Dog {
	// 	dump(b.speak()) // error: unknown method or field: Dog.speak
	// }
}
```

### Embedded interface

Interfaces support embedding, just like structs:

```v
pub interface Reader {
mut:
	read(mut buf []byte) ?int
}

pub interface Writer {
mut:
	write(buf []byte) ?int
}

// ReaderWriter embeds both Reader and Writer.
// The effect is the same as copy/pasting all of the
// Reader and all of the Writer methods/fields into
// ReaderWriter.
pub interface ReaderWriter {
	Reader
	Writer
}
```

## Function Types

You can use type aliases for naming specific function signatures - for
example:

```v
type Filter = fn (string) string
```

This works like any other type - for example, a function can accept an
argument of a function type:

```v
type Filter = fn (string) string

fn filter(s string, f Filter) string {
	return f(s)
}
```

V has duck-typing, so functions don't need to declare compatibility with
a function type - they just have to be compatible:

```v
fn uppercase(s string) string {
	return s.to_upper()
}

// now `uppercase` can be used everywhere where Filter is expected
```

Compatible functions can also be explicitly cast to a function type:

```v oksyntax
my_filter := Filter(uppercase)
```

The cast here is purely informational - again, duck-typing means that the
resulting type is the same without an explicit cast:

```v oksyntax
my_filter := uppercase
```

You can pass the assigned function as an argument:

```v oksyntax
println(filter('Hello world', my_filter)) // prints `HELLO WORLD`
```

And you could of course have passed it directly as well, without using a
local variable:

```v oksyntax
println(filter('Hello world', uppercase))
```

And this works with anonymous functions as well:

```v oksyntax
println(filter('Hello world', fn (s string) string {
	return s.to_upper()
}))
```

You can see the complete
[example here](https://github.com/vlang/v/tree/master/examples/function_types.v).

## Enums

```v
enum Color as u8 {
	red
	green
	blue
}

mut color := Color.red
// V knows that `color` is a `Color`. No need to use `color = Color.green` here.
color = .green
println(color) // "green"
match color {
	.red { println('the color was red') }
	.green { println('the color was green') }
	.blue { println('the color was blue') }
}
```
The enum type can be any integer type, but can be ommited, if it is `int`: `enum Color {`.

Enum match must be exhaustive or have an `else` branch.
This ensures that if a new enum field is added, it's handled everywhere in the code.

Enum fields cannot re-use reserved keywords. However, reserved keywords may be escaped
with an @.

```v
enum Color {
	@none
	red
	green
	blue
}

color := Color.@none
println(color)
```

Integers may be assigned to enum fields.

```v
enum Grocery {
	apple
	orange = 5
	pear
}

g1 := int(Grocery.apple)
g2 := int(Grocery.orange)
g3 := int(Grocery.pear)
println('Grocery IDs: $g1, $g2, $g3')
```

Output: `Grocery IDs: 0, 5, 6`.

Operations are not allowed on enum variables; they must be explicitly cast to `int`.

Enums can have methods, just like structs.

```v
enum Cycle {
	one
	two
	three
}

fn (c Cycle) next() Cycle {
	match c {
		.one {
			return .two
		}
		.two {
			return .three
		}
		.three {
			return .one
		}
	}
}

mut c := Cycle.one
for _ in 0 .. 10 {
	println(c)
	c = c.next()
}
```

Output:
```
one
two
three
one
two
three
one
two
three
one
```

## Sum types

A sum type instance can hold a value of several different types. Use the `type`
keyword to declare a sum type:

```v
struct Moon {}

struct Mars {}

struct Venus {}

type World = Mars | Moon | Venus

sum := World(Moon{})
assert sum.type_name() == 'Moon'
println(sum)
```
The built-in method `type_name` returns the name of the currently held
type.

With sum types you could build recursive structures and write concise but powerful code on them.
```v
// V's binary tree
struct Empty {}

struct Node {
	value f64
	left  Tree
	right Tree
}

type Tree = Empty | Node

// sum up all node values
fn sum(tree Tree) f64 {
	return match tree {
		Empty { 0 }
		Node { tree.value + sum(tree.left) + sum(tree.right) }
	}
}

fn main() {
	left := Node{0.2, Empty{}, Empty{}}
	right := Node{0.3, Empty{}, Node{0.4, Empty{}, Empty{}}}
	tree := Node{0.5, left, right}
	println(sum(tree)) // 0.2 + 0.3 + 0.4 + 0.5 = 1.4
}
```

### Dynamic casts

To check whether a sum type instance holds a certain type, use `sum is Type`.
To cast a sum type to one of its variants you can use `sum as Type`:

```v
struct Moon {}

struct Mars {}

struct Venus {}

type World = Mars | Moon | Venus

fn (m Mars) dust_storm() bool {
	return true
}

fn main() {
	mut w := World(Moon{})
	assert w is Moon
	w = Mars{}
	// use `as` to access the Mars instance
	mars := w as Mars
	if mars.dust_storm() {
		println('bad weather!')
	}
}
```

`as` will panic if `w` doesn't hold a `Mars` instance.
A safer way is to use a smart cast.

### Smart casting

```v oksyntax
if w is Mars {
	assert typeof(w).name == 'Mars'
	if w.dust_storm() {
		println('bad weather!')
	}
}
```
`w` has type `Mars` inside the body of the `if` statement. This is
known as *flow-sensitive typing*.
If `w` is a mutable identifier, it would be unsafe if the compiler smart casts it without a warning.
That's why you have to declare a `mut` before the `is` expression:

```v ignore
if mut w is Mars {
	assert typeof(w).name == 'Mars'
	if w.dust_storm() {
		println('bad weather!')
	}
}
```
Otherwise `w` would keep its original type.
> This works for both, simple variables and complex expressions like `user.name`

### Matching sum types

You can also use `match` to determine the variant:

```v
struct Moon {}

struct Mars {}

struct Venus {}

type World = Mars | Moon | Venus

fn open_parachutes(n int) {
	println(n)
}

fn land(w World) {
	match w {
		Moon {} // no atmosphere
		Mars {
			// light atmosphere
			open_parachutes(3)
		}
		Venus {
			// heavy atmosphere
			open_parachutes(1)
		}
	}
}
```

`match` must have a pattern for each variant or have an `else` branch.

```v ignore
struct Moon {}
struct Mars {}
struct Venus {}

type World = Moon | Mars | Venus

fn (m Moon) moon_walk() {}
fn (m Mars) shiver() {}
fn (v Venus) sweat() {}

fn pass_time(w World) {
    match w {
        // using the shadowed match variable, in this case `w` (smart cast)
        Moon { w.moon_walk() }
        Mars { w.shiver() }
        else {}
    }
}
```
## Type aliases

To define a new type `NewType` as an alias for `ExistingType`,
do `type NewType = ExistingType`.<br/>
This is a special case of a [sum type](#sum-types) declaration.

## Option/Result types and error handling

Optional types are for types which may represent `none`. Result types may
represent an error returned from a function.

`Option` types are declared by prepending `?` to the type name: `?Type`.
`Result` types use `!`: `!Type`.


```v
struct User {
	id   int
	name string
}

struct Repo {
	users []User
}

fn (r Repo) find_user_by_id(id int) !User {
	for user in r.users {
		if user.id == id {
			// V automatically wraps this into a result or option type
			return user
		}
	}
	return error('User $id not found')
}

// A version of the function using an optional
fn (r Repo) find_user_by_id2(id int) ?User {
	for user in r.users {
		if user.id == id {
			return user
		}
	}
	return none
}

fn main() {
	repo := Repo{
		users: [User{1, 'Andrew'}, User{2, 'Bob'}, User{10, 'Charles'}]
	}
	user := repo.find_user_by_id(10) or { // Option/Result types must be handled by `or` blocks
		println(err)
		return
	}
	println(user.id) // "10"
	println(user.name) // "Charles"

	user2 := repo.find_user_by_id2(10) or { return }
}
```

V used to combine `Option` and `Result` into one type, now they are separate.

The amount of work required to "upgrade" a function to an optional/result function is minimal;
you have to add a `?` or `!` to the return type and return an error when something goes wrong.

This is the primary mechanism for error handling in V. They are still values, like in Go,
but the advantage is that errors can't be unhandled, and handling them is a lot less verbose.
Unlike other languages, V does not handle exceptions with `throw/try/catch` blocks.

`err` is defined inside an `or` block and is set to the string message passed
to the `error()` function.

```v oksyntax
user := repo.find_user_by_id(7) or {
	println(err) // "User 7 not found"
	return
}
```

## Handling optionals/results

There are four ways of handling an optional/result. The first method is to
propagate the error:

```v
import net.http

fn f(url string) !string {
	resp := http.get(url)!
	return resp.body
}
```

`http.get` returns `!http.Response`. Because `!` follows the call, the
error will be propagated to the caller of `f`. When using `?` after a
function call producing an optional, the enclosing function must return
an optional as well. If error propagation is used in the `main()`
function it will `panic` instead, since the error cannot be propagated
any further.

The body of `f` is essentially a condensed version of:

```v ignore
    resp := http.get(url) or { return err }
    return resp.body
```

---
The second method is to break from execution early:

```v oksyntax
user := repo.find_user_by_id(7) or { return }
```

Here, you can either call `panic()` or `exit()`, which will stop the execution of the
entire program, or use a control flow statement (`return`, `break`, `continue`, etc)
to break from the current block.
Note that `break` and `continue` can only be used inside a `for` loop.

V does not have a way to forcibly "unwrap" an optional (as other languages do,
for instance Rust's `unwrap()` or Swift's `!`). To do this, use `or { panic(err) }` instead.

---
The third method is to provide a default value at the end of the `or` block.
In case of an error, that value would be assigned instead,
so it must have the same type as the content of the `Option` being handled.

```v
fn do_something(s string) !string {
	if s == 'foo' {
		return 'foo'
	}
	return error('invalid string')
}

a := do_something('foo') or { 'default' } // a will be 'foo'
b := do_something('bar') or { 'default' } // b will be 'default'
println(a)
println(b)
```

---
The fourth method is to use `if` unwrapping:

```v
import net.http

if resp := http.get('https://google.com') {
	println(resp.body) // resp is a http.Response, not an optional
} else {
	println(err)
}
```
Above, `http.get` returns a `!http.Response`. `resp` is only in scope for the first
`if` branch. `err` is only in scope for the `else` branch.
