# Runes

A `rune` represents a single Unicode character and is an alias for `u32`. To denote them, use `
(backticks) :

```v
rocket := `ğŸš€`
```

A `rune` can be converted to a UTF-8 string by using the `.str()` method.

```v
rocket := `ğŸš€`
assert rocket.str() == 'ğŸš€'
```

A `rune` can be converted to UTF-8 bytes by using the `.bytes()` method.

```v
rocket := `ğŸš€`
assert rocket.bytes() == [u8(0xf0), 0x9f, 0x9a, 0x80]
```

Hex, Unicode, and Octal escape sequences also work in a `rune` literal:

```v
assert `\x61` == `a`
assert `\141` == `a`
assert `\u0061` == `a`

// multibyte literals work too
assert `\u2605` == `â˜…`
assert `\u2605`.bytes() == [u8(0xe2), 0x98, 0x85]
assert `\xe2\x98\x85`.bytes() == [u8(0xe2), 0x98, 0x85]
assert `\342\230\205`.bytes() == [u8(0xe2), 0x98, 0x85]
```

Note that `rune` literals use the same escape syntax as strings, but they can only hold one unicode
character. Therefore, if your code does not specify a single Unicode character, you will receive an
error at compile time.

Also remember that strings are indexed as bytes, not runes, so beware:

```v
rocket_string := 'ğŸš€'
assert rocket_string[0] != `ğŸš€`
assert 'aloha!'[0] == `a`
```

A string can be converted to runes by the `.runes()` method.

```v
hello := 'Hello World ğŸ‘‹'
hello_runes := hello.runes() // [`H`, `e`, `l`, `l`, `o`, ` `, `W`, `o`, `r`, `l`, `d`, ` `, `ğŸ‘‹`]
assert hello_runes.string() == hello
```
