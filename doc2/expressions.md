# Statements & expressions

## If

```v
a := 10
b := 20
if a < b {
	println('$a < $b')
} else if a > b {
	println('$a > $b')
} else {
	println('$a == $b')
}
```

`if` statements are pretty straightforward and similar to most other languages.
Unlike other C-like languages,
there are no parentheses surrounding the condition and the braces are always required.

`if` can be used as an expression:

```v
num := 777
s := if num % 2 == 0 { 'even' } else { 'odd' }
println(s)
// "odd"
```

### Type checks and casts
You can check the current type of a sum type using `is` and its negated form `!is`.

You can do it either in an `if`:
```v cgen
struct Abc {
	val string
}

struct Xyz {
	foo string
}

type Alphabet = Abc | Xyz

x := Alphabet(Abc{'test'}) // sum type
if x is Abc {
	// x is automatically casted to Abc and can be used here
	println(x)
}
if x !is Abc {
	println('Not Abc')
}
```
or using `match`:
```v oksyntax
match x {
	Abc {
		// x is automatically casted to Abc and can be used here
		println(x)
	}
	Xyz {
		// x is automatically casted to Xyz and can be used here
		println(x)
	}
}
```

This works also with struct fields:
```v
struct MyStruct {
	x int
}

struct MyStruct2 {
	y string
}

type MySumType = MyStruct | MyStruct2

struct Abc {
	bar MySumType
}

x := Abc{
	bar: MyStruct{123} // MyStruct will be converted to MySumType type automatically
}
if x.bar is MyStruct {
	// x.bar is automatically casted
	println(x.bar)
} else if x.bar is MyStruct2 {
	new_var := x.bar as MyStruct2
	// ... or you can use `as` to create a type cast an alias manually:
	println(new_var)
}
match x.bar {
	MyStruct {
		// x.bar is automatically casted
		println(x.bar)
	}
	else {}
}
```

Mutable variables can change, and doing a cast would be unsafe.
However, sometimes it's useful to type cast despite mutability.
In such cases the developer must mark the expression with the `mut` keyword
to tell the compiler that they know what they're doing.

It works like this:
```v oksyntax
mut x := MySumType(MyStruct{123})
if mut x is MyStruct {
	// x is casted to MyStruct even if it's mutable
	// without the mut keyword that wouldn't work
	println(x)
}
// same with match
match mut x {
	MyStruct {
		// x is casted to MyStruct even if it's mutable
		// without the mut keyword that wouldn't work
		println(x)
	}
}
```

## In operator

`in` allows to check whether an array or a map contains an element.
To do the opposite, use `!in`.

```v
nums := [1, 2, 3]
println(1 in nums) // true
println(4 !in nums) // true
m := {
	'one': 1
	'two': 2
}
println('one' in m) // true
println('three' !in m) // true
```

It's also useful for writing boolean expressions that are clearer and more compact:

```v
enum Token {
	plus
	minus
	div
	mult
}

struct Parser {
	token Token
}

parser := Parser{}
if parser.token == .plus || parser.token == .minus || parser.token == .div || parser.token == .mult {
	// ...
}
if parser.token in [.plus, .minus, .div, .mult] {
	// ...
}
```

V optimizes such expressions,
so both `if` statements above produce the same machine code and no arrays are created.

## For loop

V has only one looping keyword: `for`, with several forms.

### `for`/`in`

This is the most common form. You can use it with an array, map or
numeric range.

#### Array `for`

```v
numbers := [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers {
	println(num)
}
names := ['Sam', 'Peter']
for i, name in names {
	println('$i) $name')
	// Output: 0) Sam
	//         1) Peter
}
```

The `for value in arr` form is used for going through elements of an array.
If an index is required, an alternative form `for index, value in arr` can be used.

Note, that the value is read-only.
If you need to modify the array while looping, you need to declare the element as mutable:

```v
mut numbers := [0, 1, 2]
for mut num in numbers {
	num++
}
println(numbers) // [1, 2, 3]
```
When an identifier is just a single underscore, it is ignored.

#### Custom iterators
Types that implement a `next` method returning an `Option` can be iterated
with a `for` loop.

```v
struct SquareIterator {
	arr []int
mut:
	idx int
}

fn (mut iter SquareIterator) next() ?int {
	if iter.idx >= iter.arr.len {
		return error('')
	}
	defer {
		iter.idx++
	}
	return iter.arr[iter.idx] * iter.arr[iter.idx]
}

nums := [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
iter := SquareIterator{
	arr: nums
}
for squared in iter {
	println(squared)
}
```

The code above prints:
```
1
4
9
16
25
```

#### Map `for`

```v
m := {
	'one': 1
	'two': 2
}
for key, value in m {
	println('$key -> $value')
	// Output: one -> 1
	//         two -> 2
}
```

Either key or value can be ignored by using a single underscore as the identifier.
```v
m := {
	'one': 1
	'two': 2
}
// iterate over keys
for key, _ in m {
	println(key)
	// Output: one
	//         two
}
// iterate over values
for _, value in m {
	println(value)
	// Output: 1
	//         2
}
```

#### Range `for`

```v
// Prints '01234'
for i in 0 .. 5 {
	print(i)
}
```
`low..high` means an *exclusive* range, which represents all values
from `low` up to *but not including* `high`.

### Condition `for`

```v
mut sum := 0
mut i := 0
for i <= 100 {
	sum += i
	i++
}
println(sum) // "5050"
```

This form of the loop is similar to `while` loops in other languages.
The loop will stop iterating once the boolean condition evaluates to false.
Again, there are no parentheses surrounding the condition, and the braces are always required.

### Bare `for`

```v
mut num := 0
for {
	num += 2
	if num >= 10 {
		break
	}
}
println(num) // "10"
```

The condition can be omitted, resulting in an infinite loop.

### C `for`

```v
for i := 0; i < 10; i += 2 {
	// Don't print 6
	if i == 6 {
		continue
	}
	println(i)
}
```

Finally, there's the traditional C style `for` loop. It's safer than the `while` form
because with the latter it's easy to forget to update the counter and get
stuck in an infinite loop.

Here `i` doesn't need to be declared with `mut` since it's always going to be mutable by definition.

### Labelled break & continue

`break` and `continue` control the innermost `for` loop by default.
You can also use `break` and `continue` followed by a label name to refer to an outer `for`
loop:

```v
outer: for i := 4; true; i++ {
	println(i)
	for {
		if i < 7 {
			continue outer
		} else {
			break outer
		}
	}
}
```
The label must immediately precede the outer loop.
The above code prints:
```
4
5
6
7
```

## Match

```v
os := 'windows'
print('V is running on ')
match os {
	'darwin' { println('macOS.') }
	'linux' { println('Linux.') }
	else { println(os) }
}
```

A match statement is a shorter way to write a sequence of `if - else` statements.
When a matching branch is found, the following statement block will be run.
The else branch will be run when no other branches match.

```v
number := 2
s := match number {
	1 { 'one' }
	2 { 'two' }
	else { 'many' }
}
```

A match statement can also to be used as an `if - else if - else` alternative:

```v
match true {
	2 > 4 { println('if') }
	3 == 4 { println('else if') }
	2 == 2 { println('else if2') }
	else { println('else') }
}
// 'else if2' should be printed
```

or as an `unless` alternative: [unless Ruby](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_if_else.htm)

```v
match false {
	2 > 4 { println('if') }
	3 == 4 { println('else if') }
	2 == 2 { println('else if2') }
	else { println('else') }
}
// 'if' should be printed
```

A match expression returns the value of the final expression from the matching branch.

```v
enum Color {
	red
	blue
	green
}

fn is_red_or_blue(c Color) bool {
	return match c {
		.red, .blue { true } // comma can be used to test multiple values
		.green { false }
	}
}
```

A match statement can also be used to branch on the variants of an `enum`
by using the shorthand `.variant_here` syntax. An `else` branch is not allowed
when all the branches are exhaustive.

```v
c := `v`
typ := match c {
	`0`...`9` { 'digit' }
	`A`...`Z` { 'uppercase' }
	`a`...`z` { 'lowercase' }
	else { 'other' }
}
println(typ)
// 'lowercase'
```

You can also use ranges as `match` patterns. If the value falls within the range
of a branch, that branch will be executed.

Note that the ranges use `...` (three dots) rather than `..` (two dots). This is
because the range is *inclusive* of the last element, rather than exclusive
(as `..` ranges are). Using `..` in a match branch will throw an error.

Note: `match` as an expression is not usable in `for` loop and `if` statements.

## Defer

A defer statement defers the execution of a block of statements
until the surrounding function returns.

```v
import os

fn read_log() {
	mut ok := false
	mut f := os.open('log.txt') or { panic(err) }
	defer {
		f.close()
	}
	// ...
	if !ok {
		// defer statement will be called here, the file will be closed
		return
	}
	// ...
	// defer statement will be called here, the file will be closed
}
```

If the function returns a value the `defer` block is executed *after* the return
expression is evaluated:

```v
import os

enum State {
	normal
	write_log
	return_error
}

// write log file and return number of bytes written
fn write_log(s State) ?int {
	mut f := os.create('log.txt')?
	defer {
		f.close()
	}
	if s == .write_log {
		// `f.close()` will be called after `f.write()` has been
		// executed, but before `write_log()` finally returns the
		// number of bytes written to `main()`
		return f.writeln('This is a log file')
	} else if s == .return_error {
		// the file will be closed after the `error()` function
		// has returned - so the error message will still report
		// it as open
		return error('nothing written; file open: $f.is_opened')
	}
	// the file will be closed here, too
	return 0
}

fn main() {
	n := write_log(.return_error) or {
		println('Error: $err')
		0
	}
	println('$n bytes written')
}
```
